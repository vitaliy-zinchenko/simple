Hello everyone, I've got a grammatical question regarding the definite article 'the':Definite article before of-phrases. I've got quite confused using this phrase; for example, The learning of the third language provides an interesting context for research vs Learning of the third language… (without the definite article ‘the’). I’ve faced a lot of examples like this, interestingly, even in the same book on different pages, one with definite article ‘the’ and the other one or other ones without it!I've found it rather personal, that is, it depends on the author to whether use it or drop it. I've asked some of my professors holding PhD in TEFL, and they've had the same idea. They say if you ask me whether we should use the definite article in an of-phrase, we can say whether it is necessary to use it, but we do not know why!I would be grateful if you could clarify the difference between using and not using the definite article ‘the’ in of-phrases, if there is any of course! That is, whether it makes any difference, in meaning, to use it or not use it.Thank you in advance, Reza Hello Adam,No, 'of-phrases' is whole another story. The definite article 'the' in 'of-phrases' seeks to define the following 'of-phrase'. But sometimes it is used, while other times not! (as in my example) Because of what? A mystery to me! I've searched a lot on the Internet, and I've found some reasons, but those reasons are specific to that special situation and cannot be generalised.Am I required to remind you to answer my question in the next few weeks? Because you're busy managing LearnEnglish and may forget to answer my question.Regards,Reza As Adam implies, and as your example shows, the presence of an of-phrase does not guarantee that the definite article is necessary. As you know, we use the definite article when we believe the hearer/reader knows exactly what we are referring to and an of-phrase often, but not always, defines the noun sufficiently precisely to make this the case. A further question is how we see the item being discussed - are we talking in general/abstract terms (in which case the zero article is likely) or about a concrete and specific case (in which case the definite article is likely)? Our use of articles is often dependent on not only the noun and particular sentence structure, but also the context, our intention, how we see the topic and what we know or believe about our audience.Given these variables, I think you can see why the speaker often has a choice as to whether or not to use the article. In many cases, as you have said, both options are possible and only in a clear given context, with knowledge of the speaker and listener's relationship to each other and their knowledge of the topic, can we analyse why the article was used or not. Analysing bare sentences without this knowledge is not really possible - all we can do in that case is to identify numerous possibilities which may or may not be true (such as the topic being familar to both, or the discussion referring to a specific case, or the case being contrasted to an earlier mentioned case etc.). Such analysis is simply an exercise in guesswork as the question is not a question of rules but a question of context and individual choice.
